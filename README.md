### About

Each group has a page within the website. A group can launch a campaign, call for
an action and publish a news article. All of these pieces of content are displayed
on a group's page, creating a mini-site.

The following Drupal 8 modules should be installed via composer: address,
config_actions, config_perms, drutopia_core, group, ds, pathauto, paragraphs

### Potential Future Features

* Group membership
* Group only content
* Integration with other tools such as: Discourse, Facebook, Loomio, Slack, Twitter
